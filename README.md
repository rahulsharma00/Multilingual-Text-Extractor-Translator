# Multilingual-Text-Extractor-Translator

This is a `Streamlit`-based web application that allows users to extract text from images and translate the extracted text into English (if the text is in another language). The application supports two languages: English and Hindi. It uses `EasyOCR` for text extraction and `Google Translator` for translation.
